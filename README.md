‚úãüèΩ Hello, my name is Milson, I'm 28 years old and I'm from S√£o Paulo, Brazil

I'm founder and CEO of bounties4, a software quality platform focused on helping tech companies accelerate the expansion of automated testing and improve the quality culture in software engineering teams.

We enable significant reductions in the time spent on manual testing and bug fixing and offer AI-generated insights to raise software quality maturity for software engineering managers.

We were proudly invested in a pre-seed round by executives from Google, McKinsey and renowned entrepreneurs such as the founders of Gupy, Apontador, Doji and EquitasVC (a fund focused on technical founders).
